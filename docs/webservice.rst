***********
Web service
***********

Comics comes with a web service that exposes all useful data about the
current user, the user's comics subscriptions, comics, comic releases, and
comic images. The web service may be used to e.g. create iOS/Android apps or
alternative comics browsers, while leaving the comics crawling job to a
Comics instance.

Please make any apps using this API generic, so that they can be used with any
Comics instance as the backend. In other words, when starting your app, let
the end user enter the hostname of the Comics instance, in addition to his
secret key or email/password pair.


Authentication
==============

The web service is only available for users with an active user account on the
Comics instance. The user must authenticate himself using the same
secret key as is used to access comic feeds. The key can be found in the
account section of the Comics instance.

The secret key can be provided in one of two ways:

- Using a HTTP GET parameter named ``key``, i.e. as part of the URL. Example::

      http://example.com/api/v1/users/?key=76acdcdf16ae4e12becb00d09a9d9456

- Using the ``Authorization`` HTTP header. Example::

      Authorization: Key 76acdcdf16ae4e12becb00d09a9d9456


Get secret key using email and password
---------------------------------------

If it's inconvenient for the end user to enter the secret key in your user
interface--on mobile phones copy-pasting the API key from the Comics
instance's account page is time consuming at best--you may retrieve the secret
key on behalf of the end user by following steps:

1. Ask the end user to provide:

   - the Comics instance's base URL (e.g. ``example.com``)

   - the email address the end user have registered on the Comics instance

   - the password the end user have registered on the Comics instance

2. Use the provided information to retrieve the :ref:`users-resource` from the
   API. Authenticate using `Basic Authentication
   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication>`_ with the email
   address as username and the password as password. This does only work for
   the :ref:`users-resource`.

3. In the response from the :ref:`users-resource`, you'll find the end user's
   secret key. You should cache the secret key in your application and use it
   for all future requests to the API on behalf of this user. The end user's
   password should be thrown away at this point.


Response format
===============

You can specify what response format you prefer in one of two ways:

- Using a HTTP GET parameter named ``format``, i.e. as part of the URL.
  Examples::

      # Returns JSON
      http://example.com/api/v1/?format=json

      # Returns JSONP with function name 'callback'
      http://example.com/api/v1/?format=jsonp

      # Returns JSONP with function name 'foo'
      http://example.com/api/v1/?format=jsonp&callback=foo

      # Returns JSONP with function name 'foo'
      http://example.com/api/v1/?callback=foo

      # Returns XML
      http://example.com/api/v1/?format=xml

      # Returns YAML
      http://example.com/api/v1/?format=yaml

      # Returns Apple binary plist
      http://example.com/api/v1/?format=plist

- Using the ``Accept`` HTTP header. Examples::

      # Returns JSON
      Accept: application/json

      # Returns JSONP with function name 'callback'
      Accept: text/javascript

      # Returns XML
      Accept: application/xml

      # Returns YAML
      Accept: text/yaml

      # Returns Apple binary plist
      Accept: application/x-plist

JSON and JSONP are always supported. Other formats like XML, YAML, and Apple
binary plists (bplist) may be available if the Comics instance got the
additional dependencies required by the format installed.

If you run a Comics instance yourself, and want support for more response
formats, check out `Tastypie's serialization docs
<https://django-tastypie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/serialization.html>`_ for
details on what you need to install.


.. _pagination:

Pagination
==========

All the resource collections support pagination. The pagination parameters that
may be passed as :http:method:`GET` arguments are:

- **limit** -- max number of returned resources per response. Defaults to 20.
  Use 0 to remove the limit and request all objects in a single response.

- **offset** -- offset into the full collection of resources. Defaults to 0.

The ``meta`` section of the collection responses include the current pagination
parameters, and--if available--links to the previous and next page, and the
total count of resources matching the query:

- **next** -- link to the next page of the collection, if available

- **previous** -- link to the previous page of the collection, if available

- **total_count** -- total number of resources in the collection, given the
  current filters.


Resources
=========

Root resource
-------------

.. http:get:: /api/v1/

    Lists all available resources, and URLs for their schemas.


.. _users-resource:

Users resource
--------------

.. http:get:: /api/v1/users/

    List of all authenticated users. Not surprisingly, it always has a single result.

    **Example request using secret key**

    .. sourcecode:: http

        GET /api/v1/users/ HTTP/1.1

        Accept: application/json
        Authorization: Key 76acdcdf16ae4e12becb00d09a9d9456

    **Example request using Basic Authentication**

    This is the only resource that also accepts `Basic Authentication`_, using
    the user's email address and password. Use the secret key from the response
    for authenticating all future requests to the API.

    .. sourcecode:: http

        GET /api/v1/users/ HTTP/1.1
        Host: example.com
        Accept: application/json

Images resource
---------------

You will probably not use the images resource, as the images are available
through the ``releases`` resource as well. The images resource is included to
give the images referenced to by releases their own canonical URLs.

.. http:get:: /api/v1/images/

    Lists all images. Supports :ref:`pagination`.

    :query fetched: only include images with fetched matching. Date range
        queries are supported.
    :query title: only include images with matching title. Queries like
        ``title__icontains=cake`` are supported.
    :query text: only include images with matching text. Queries like
        ``text__icontains=lies`` are supported.
    :query height: only include images with height matching. Integer range
        queries, like ``height__gt=1000`` are supported.
    :query width: only include images with width matching. Integer range
        queries are supported.

    :statuscode 200: no error
    :statuscode 400: bad request, e.g. unknown filter used
    :statuscode 401: authentication/authorization failed


.. http:get:: /api/v1/images/(int:image_id)/

    Show a specific image looked up by image ID.

    :param image_id: the image ID

    :statuscode 401: authentication/authorization failed
    :statuscode 404: image not found


Subscriptions resource
----------------------

.. http:get:: /api/v1/subscriptions/

    List all the authenticated user's comic subscriptions. Supports
    :ref:`pagination`.
